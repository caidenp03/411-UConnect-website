<p>
A Bachelor's degree is not enough to qualify for many early-career positions.
But how can one get experience if they aren't hireable due to their lack of experience? 

The good news: College students are surrounded by other students who want an opportunity to use their skills.

For example, let's imagine that a film student wants to make a short movie. There are theatre majors who need projects to act in, and English majors who would love to see their writing converted onto the silver screen.

â€¦But students don't always seek out other students on their own.

The solution? A service that allows college students who want to create a project to meet students who need opportunities to use their skills.
