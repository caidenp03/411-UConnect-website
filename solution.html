Facility is a web application that acts as a platform for college students to allow them to reach other students to work on projects for experience and to put on their resumes.
A user acting as a ‘Project Launcher’ can make posts describing the project they wish to launch, along with the skills or fields of study they’ll need expertise in from someone else.
‘Project seekers’ can browse these posts to find projects they wish to join.
Project launchers who need help from seekers can browse student profiles to see reviews and find students to reach out to.
